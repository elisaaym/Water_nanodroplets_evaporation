# Water_nanodroplets_evaporation
This repository hosts the data collected through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for water nanodroplets evaporating in varying temperature, close to 0% RH condition. The article (submitted but not reviewed/published yet) reference to this dataset will be provided when the article is accepted and published. The data is made publicly available to encourage the expansion of dataset relating to evaporation of water nanodroplets, and the comparison of different machine learning methods that can be applied to build an efficient data-driven model for nanodroplets evaporation prediction.
